# SLAM
Some Study Codes and Projects about SLAM

# Contents
1. Eg01_UseEigen

    Use Eigen library
2. Eg02_UseGeometry

    Some conversions between different geometry representation, like rotation matrix, angle axis, euler angles and quaterniond
3. Eg03_UseSophus

    use Sophus library to study Lie algebra and groups
4. Eg04_JoinMap

    Use PCL(Point Cloud Library) to join map from RGB-D images
5. Eg05_UseCeres

    Curve fit using Ceres
6. Eg06_UseG2O

    Curve fit using g2o
7. Eg07_FeatureDetectMatch

    Feature detect and match using OpenCV, and use features to estimate pose in 2D-2D
8. Eg08_PoseEstimation2D2D

    Estimate camera pos 2D-2D using epipolar geometry costraints, and triangulatio to obtain 3D point in world.
9. Eg09_PoseEstimation3D2D

    Get camera pose using PnP algorithm, and use bundle adjustment to optimize the pose.

10. Eg10_PoseEstimation3D3D

    Get camera pose using ICP algorithm(SVD and bundle adjustment) based on 3D-3D point pairs.

# Problems
Some error occurs about LinearSolverCholmod/LinearSolverCSparse, and cannot find solution, try again later.
